# üê≥ Docker Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve Docker deployment issues in the Cambria Dashboard.

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing curl in Production Container**
- **Problem**: Health checks were failing because `curl` was not installed in the runner stage
- **Fix**: Added `curl` to the Alpine packages in the runner stage
- **File**: `Dockerfile` (line 47)

### 2. **Unreliable Health Check Endpoint**
- **Problem**: Health check was using `/api/auth/session` which might not be available during startup
- **Fix**: Changed to use the root endpoint `/` which is always available
- **Files**: `Dockerfile` (line 58), `docker-compose.yml` (line 25)

### 3. **Insufficient Health Check Timeouts**
- **Problem**: Health check timeouts were too short (3s) and start period too short (5s)
- **Fix**: Increased timeout to 10s and start period to 30s for better reliability
- **Files**: `Dockerfile` (line 58), `docker-compose.yml` (line 26-29)

### 4. **Missing Environment Variable Validation**
- **Problem**: No validation of required environment variables during startup
- **Fix**: Created startup script (`scripts/start.sh`) with environment validation
- **File**: `scripts/start.sh`

### 5. **Suboptimal Next.js Configuration**
- **Problem**: Next.js configuration wasn't fully optimized for Docker deployment
- **Fix**: Enhanced `next.config.ts` with better standalone output configuration
- **File**: `next.config.ts`

### 6. **No Deployment Automation**
- **Problem**: Manual deployment process was error-prone
- **Fix**: Created automated deployment script (`scripts/deploy.sh`)
- **File**: `scripts/deploy.sh`

### 7. **Lack of Troubleshooting Tools**
- **Problem**: No systematic way to diagnose Docker issues
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive troubleshooting script (`scripts/troubleshoot-docker.sh`)
- **File**: `scripts/troubleshoot-docker.sh`

### 8. **Missing .dockerignore**
- **Problem**: Build context included unnecessary files, slowing builds
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive `.dockerignore` file
- **File**: `.dockerignore`

## üìÅ Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed health checks, added curl, improved startup
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated health check configuration
- `next.config.ts` - Enhanced for Docker deployment
- `DOCKER_README.md` - Updated with new scripts and fixes

### New Files:
- `scripts/start.sh` - Startup script with environment validation
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Automated deployment script
- `scripts/troubleshoot-docker.sh` - Troubleshooting script
- `.dockerignore` - Optimized build context
- `DOCKER_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## üöÄ How to Deploy

### Quick Start (Recommended):
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run automated deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Manual Deployment:
```bash
# Build and start
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Troubleshooting:
```bash
# Run troubleshooting script
./scripts/troubleshoot-docker.sh
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the following:

1. **Container is running**: `docker-compose ps`
2. **Health check passes**: Container status shows "healthy"
3. **Application accessible**: `curl http://localhost:3000/`
4. **Logs are clean**: `docker-compose logs --tail=20`

## üîç Key Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Better health checks and timeouts
2. **Automation**: Automated deployment and troubleshooting
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and validation
4. **Performance**: Optimized build process with .dockerignore
5. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and health monitoring
6. **Security**: Non-root user and proper permissions

## üÜò Support

If issues persist:

1. Run `./scripts/troubleshoot-docker.sh`
2. Check `docker-compose logs`
3. Verify environment variables in `.env`
4. Ensure Docker daemon is running
5. Check port availability

## üìù Notes

- All scripts are executable and include proper error handling
- Health checks now use reliable endpoints with appropriate timeouts
- Startup script validates environment before starting the application
- Deployment script provides real-time feedback and monitoring
- Troubleshooting script covers common Docker issues
